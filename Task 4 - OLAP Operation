------3) OLAP Operation

-------- a) Write a query to perform drill down from region to product level to understand sales performance.
SELECT Product_Id, Region, SUM (Sales_amount) AS sales_performance
FROM Sales_sample
GROUP BY Product_Id, Region;

---------- b) Write a query to perform roll up from product to region level to view total sales by region.
SELECT Region, SUM (Sales_amount) AS Total_sales
FROM Sales_sample
GROUP BY Region;

---------- c) Write a query to explore sales data from different perspectives, such as product, region and date.

SELECT Product_Id, Region, Date, SUM (Sales_amount) AS sales
FROM Sales_sample
GROUP BY Product_Id, Region, Date;

-------- d) Write a query to slice the data to view sales for a particular region or date range.

SELECT Date, SUM (Sales_amount) AS sales
FROM Sales_sample
WHERE Date = '2023-06-10'
GROUP BY Date;

(Or) 
SELECT Region, SUM (Sales_amount) AS sales
FROM Sales_sample
WHERE Region = 'South'
GROUP BY Region;


-------e) Write a query to view sales for a specific combination of product, region and date.

SELECT Product_Id, Region, Date, Sales_amount
FROM Sales_sample
WHERE Product_Id = 3 AND Region = 'North' AND Date = '2023-06-03';
